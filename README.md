I've been wanting to start taking the way I read and learn from DL and RL papers more seriously, and I decided I want start implementing the algorithms I encounter in these papers in code (python) for no other reasons but fun, and learning. By starting this repository, I can no longer hide behind the excuse of not having one for this purpose. Thas about it!
Enjoy! <3 8==D~~~~
